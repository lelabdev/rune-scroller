## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-02

### Added

- `runeScroller` action as recommended API for sentinel-based animation triggering
- `dom-utils.svelte.ts` module with reusable DOM manipulation utilities
- `repeat` option for `runeScroller` action to support repeating animations
- Memory leak prevention for animations in repeat mode
- Updated `.npmignore` to exclude test files from npm distribution

### Improved

- Extracted repeated DOM manipulation patterns into utility functions
- Fixed observer lifecycle management to properly clean up in all cases
- Enhanced `animate.svelte.ts` to handle dynamic threshold/rootMargin changes
- Optimized sentinel creation using single `cssText` statement
- Reduced code duplication throughout the library

### Performance

- Bundle size further optimized (~3.6 KB reduction from test file exclusion)
- Fewer DOM operations via optimized utility functions
- Better memory efficiency on content-heavy pages with many animations

### Documentation

- Updated README with architecture improvements
- Added section documenting optimizations and performance impact
- Clarified "14 animations" (was previously listed as "14+" or "26+")
